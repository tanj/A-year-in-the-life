A Tale of Reciepts and Mileage


I have been up since 04:30. I spent an anxious night waiting for my
alarm clock to go off; I got up before it did. Sunday night had been
spent packing my saddle bags. There isn't really that much you can
take on a motorcycle. A pair of shorts, a couple of T's, pair of neat
jeans, and a button down shirt for church. Small clothes and swimming
trunks. I took a shower, which had to last me three days, and had
breakfast. Then I started to load up the bike.

It is 06:10 and the bike is warming up. I snap a picture to
commemorate the start of my trip across Canada. Time to leave. I
forget to put my ear plugs in, but I have to fill up before I leave
the city so I'll put them in then.

With a fresh tank of fuel I hit the road for the first leg. I almost
left without putting the ear plugs in. I either have a real problem
with my short term memory or I a really exicted to get on the road. I
will let you be the judge, but my bias in toward the memory. ( I might
just be forgetting the thrill of it all. )

I start my trip on the very exciting 401 Highway. OK, so it is boring
and empty on holiday Monday at 06:30. No one said this story has to be
constant excitement. In fact I'll tell you right now, it is rather
dull. Maybe the fact that the highlights are gas station reciepts
tipped you off to this already. I just wanted this out in the open
from the begining.

My first hour and a half on the road goes by fairly fast, 120km/h for
the most part. I am at Highway 6, North before I know it. This is all
familiar road for me. I travel this section every time I go to visit
my sister Christina in Guelph. As I drive past the Sleeman Brewing Co.,
my usual turn off, I think about all the things that lay before her in
this coming year. Sound for Campus for Christ, leading a womans
discussion group, growing in her relationship with God together with
her boyfriend Nick. I pray for her and Nick. I pray for all the
leaders in Campus for Christ.

I stop for a coffee and donut at Tim Hortons to warm up before I
'really' start my trip. Vacations don't really start until you are
outside of your normal area. I follow Highway 6 North to Fergus and
then take Wellington County Rd 10 to Orangeville.

My first fill up on the road also coincides with my first bathroom
break. ( Sound of a needle scraping across a record. ) What is this
guy thinking? Where is the value added content in this information? Do
we, if you pardon the pun, really give a crap? If you answered "He
clearly isn't; There is none; and No!" then you are not alone. It
does, however, afford us the opportunity while the main character is
otherwise occupied to examine some minor, but important, details.

The motorcycle being used is a red, black, and silver 1993 Honda
CBR600F2. This machine has been in the possession of John teBokkel,
our main character, since the spring of 2008. It has already seen a
trip through northern Ontario and 13,000+ km in its first season. It
is currently adorned with Oxford Sport saddle bags, a bright orange
Seal Sack with a bivy sack, sleeping bag, and Thermal Rest inside. This
is all strapped to back as would be expected. Upfront we have a Oxford
Sport magnetic tank bag, which has been zipped off and currently is
safely with our main character. As he finally exits the gas station,
we see that he is also carrying a red back pack.

Ahem! I am telling the story here! Why don't you go make love with a
cactus!

As you may observe this fellow is not always the pleasent type. He has
a habit of saying rude things to people that are just trying to make a
boring tale interesting.

Ha! It is interesting without your inane chatter. I can tell the story
without you. 

And some story that will be! Trees and rocks and rocks and trees and
asphalt and water. Oh, and fuel stops. You need to let someone add
some excitement and paint the pictures.

Oh, alright, but try and keep it to the times when I can't hear. There
is nothing I hate more then listening to myself talk about
myself. Now, where were we?

I was about to describe you checking the straps and getting back on
the bike.

I knew that...

Sure you did....

Highway 9 East out of Orangeville. It is a little depressing that for
the first half of the first day I spend it traveling away from my
final destination. That is hindsight talking, as nothing is depressing
on the first day of a trip. At least when the sun is shining. I drive
on HWY 9 until it intersects with County Rd 27 North. I can't say what
caused me to turn north here instead of continuing on to Highway
400. It is nice to stay off fast highways though and I enjoyed the
unplanned detour. I got on the 400 where it meets Highway 89.

Once on the 400 and moving quickly again. I think of other times I
have traveled this section. Most notably the times driving Christina
up to her nanny job in Perry Sound. Of driving up with Dad to pick up
her stuff after she had to quit. Even earlier then that, the first
time driving the other way, with my dad and sister Angelina when we
first moved back to London to go to school.

As I head north, the skies get more overcast. I get to Perry Sound
before the rain starts, but only barely.
